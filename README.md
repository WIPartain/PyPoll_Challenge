# PyPoll_Challenge

Module 3 challenge
## Overview
We have been tasked with providing additional information for the results of an election audit run by the Colorado Board of Elections.  After completing the initial audit, we were asked to provide the following information:
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage vote from each county out of the count total
* The county with the highest turnout.


## Election Audit Results
After running our code with the new changes, we yielded the following results
* Voter Turnout: There were 369,711 votes cast during this election
* Percentage Vote for each county: Jefferson Coutny had 10.5% of the votes, Denver county had 82.8% of the votes, and Arapahoe county had 6.7% of the votes
* The county with the highest turnout: Denver had far and away the largest voter turnout.
